It was first published on 14 October 1892, though the individual stories had been serialised in The Strand Magazine between June 1891 and July 1892. The stories are not in chronological order, and the only characters common to all twelve are Holmes and Dr. Watson. As with all but four of the Sherlock Holmes stories, those contained within The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes are told by a first-person narrative from the point of view of Dr. Watson. In general the stories in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes identify, and try to correct, social injustices. Holmes is portrayed as offering a new, fairer sense of justice. The stories were well received, and boosted the subscriptions figures of The Strand Magazine, prompting Doyle to be able to demand more money for his next set of stories. The first story, \"A Scandal in Bohemia\", includes the character of Irene Adler, who, despite being featured only within this one story by Doyle, is a prominent character in modern Sherlock Holmes adaptations, generally as a love interest for Holmes. Doyle included four of the twelve stories from this collection in his twelve favourite Sherlock Holmes stories, picking \"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\" as his overall favourite.</td>\n",

       "14122   A Sherlock tie-in edition of Conan Doyle's first collection of Sherlock Holmes stories, with an introduction by show cocreator Mark Gatiss\\nIn this new edition of Conan Doyle's first collection of short stories, Mark Gatiss explains how these gripping tales inspired and influenced the new series. This collection contains 12 short stories first published in theStrandmagazine between 1891 and 1892, and then published as a collection in October 1892. It includes some of Conan Doyle's best tales of murder and mystery, such as \"The Adventures of the Speckled Band,\" in which the strange last words of a dying woman \"It was the band, the speckled band!\" and an inexplicable whistling in the night are the only clues Sherlock Holmes has to prevent another murder; and \"The Five Orange Pips,\" in which an untimely death and the discovery of the letter containing five orange pips lead to a cross-Atlantic conspiracy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "218916  Arthur Conan Doyle\\nHow is this book unique?\\nIllustrations Included\\nFree Audiobook\\nUnabridged Edition\\nOriginal Edition\\nE-Reader friendly\\nThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a collection of twelve short stories by Arthur Conan Doyle, featuring his fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. It was first published on 14 October 1892, though the individual stories had been serialised in The Strand Magazine between June 1891 and July 1892. The stories are not in chronological order, and the only characters common to all twelve are Holmes and Dr. Watson. As with all but four of the Sherlock Holmes stories, those contained within The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes are told by a first-person narrative from the point of view of Dr. Watson. In general the stories in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes identify, and try to correct, social injustices. Holmes is portrayed as offering a new, fairer sense of justice. The stories were well received, and boosted the subscriptions figures of The Strand Magazine, prompting Doyle to be able to demand more money for his next set of stories. The first story, \"A Scandal in Bohemia\", includes the character of Irene Adler, who, despite being featured only within this one story by Doyle, is a prominent character in modern Sherlock Holmes adaptations, generally as a love interest for Holmes. Doyle included four of the twelve stories from this collection in his twelve favourite Sherlock Holmes stories, picking \"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\" as his overall favourite.   \n",
